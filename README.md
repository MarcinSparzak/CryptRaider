===================================

At the beggining you need to go to a cell and pick up a small statue (click and hold LMB). Place the statue in the alcove opposite the entrance. 

At the end of the corridor there is a crypt. After taking golden statue from the pedestal gate is closing down preventing player from exiting. You need to place another object on the pedestal for gate to open.
